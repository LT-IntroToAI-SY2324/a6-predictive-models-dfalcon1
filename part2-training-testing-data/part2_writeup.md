# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?
the predicted data came from training data which allowed predictions to be more accurate because the predictions are based on previous trends that said predictions have trained on

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?
the closer it is to 1 the more accurate it is while the closer to 0.50 the more inaccurate it is.

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.
 Not really as the R^2 value is very low causing major shifts in the graph causing the trendline to be inaccurate which heavily affects the data of the predictions.
